			<h1>Space Law</h1><br/>
			Edition 56: S.P.L.U.R.T Initiative Edition<br/>
			Authorised by Lewis Lance, 1st Central Command Admiral<br/>
			Edited by Benny Moff, 4th Central Command Admiral<br/>

			<h2>Foreword on Robustness</h2>
			To be robust is not mearly the act of being able to win a fight. A robust man not only knows himself and his attacker, but the situation of the station as a whole.
			To be robust is to know what can be done to prevent catastrophy - and do it. Whether you are a medical doctor on the front lines, helping
			to keep your fellow spacemen in the fight, or an engineer ensuring the hull is intact and the air breathable, you are all robust. And you, the one who reads this,
			you too can be robust. Realise that there is more to this station than whoever stands before you. Be vigilant. Be kind. Respect your adversary, and they will
			respect you.<br/>
			<br/>
